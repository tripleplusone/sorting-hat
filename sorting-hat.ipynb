Each house has certain characteristics, and when the Sorting Hat is placed on a student's head, it reads their minds and determines which house they would be the best fit for. By this definition, the Sorting Hat is a multiclass classifier (more than two groups) as opposed to a binary classifier (exactly two groups), like an spam filter."

Here's a short list of ideas for future enhancements:\n",
