Hi there,

This notebook details my first attempt at re-creating the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter using data from the web (via the [Fandom API](http://api.wikia.com/wiki/Quick_Start)) and simple text analysis (via the `nltk` module). 

The folks at yhat were kind enough to publish it on their blog. You can find it [here](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/harry-potter-classification.html).

Feel free to use this code for your own projects. If you do something cool with it, [shoot me an email](<mailto:bryan.berend@gmail.com>). 

**Note, 01/28/2018:** The code to classify and search for words is really messy and inefficient :-/. Should've used regex.

**Note, 03/16/2018:** Apparently the Fandom API no longer exists, so this analysis is not reproducible.
